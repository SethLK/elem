Elem is a compiled systems programming language inspired by Go, Rust and C, built for simplicity, speed, and low-level control.

Flow is of Elem

[Source Code] -> [Object] -> [Machine Code]

and, yes, it is similar to C and other compiled languages.

"Hello World!"

    import "io";

	    io.printLn("Hello World!");
    }
